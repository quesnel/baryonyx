- Add the default algorithm (binary and equalities)
- Add the integer algorithm (integer and inequalities)
- Provides a cuda implementation of the binary and inequalities
  solver.

- check random generator has a different seed for each thread
(long) std::clock() + (long) std::hash<std::thread::id>{}(std::this_thread::get_id())
