== baryonyx v0.4.0 - 2019-02-19

Bump C++ dependency to C++17 standard.

main::

* benchmark: add a second output `csv` file with the rank for each solvers and
  models to show best solver.

solver/optimizer::

* Optimize all solver algorithms to improve performance: rewrite and
  generalize.

* Improve the `best-cycle` algorithm: is no best solution was found for three
  complete optimization, solver restart to `bastert-cycle`.

* Fix the initialization cycle behaviour.

* Fix the random normalization behaviour.

* Remove useless header (sparse-vector etc), dead code.

== baryonyx v0.3.4 - 2019-01-17

main::

* benchmark: add a benchmark mode to permit to run benchmark on a set of
  problems described in a `csv` files and make easy comparison.

* colours: improve colour rendering in log system. Replace specific Linux/Unix
  source code about colour in (pseudo)terminal with the `fmt::text_style` and
  `fmt::terminal_color` enumeration.

* add warning message for unknown parameters

solver/optimizer::

* core: add init policy cycle:
  ** `bastert` (default): use cost values.
  ** `random`: use random value.
  ** `best`: use best solution found if available (`bastert` otherwise).
  ** `bastert-cycle`: start with bastert policy then start a cycle between
       random, best and bastert.
  ** `random-cycle`: start with random policy then start a cycle between best,
       bastert and random.
  ** `best-cycle`: start with best policy then start a cycle between bastert,
       random and best.

* core: add lagrangian runtime constraint order.
  ** `lagrangian-decr`: sort violated constraints according to the Lagrangian
     multiplier values in decremental order.
  ** `lagrangian-incr`: sort violated constraints according to the Lagrangian
     multiplier values in incremental order

== baryonyx v0.3.3 - 2018-10-04

main::

* output: better render output float number

solver/optimizer::

* Fix the preference matrix assignment for both equalities and inequalities
  with -1 and 1 coefficients, we replace the preference matrix clean up
  algorithm (invert the variable values for negative coefficients) with a
  version that revert only the added or subtracted value during the preferences
  update process.
* Fix core dump if no solution are found

preprocessor::

* update the preprocessing solver option: Replace the old preprocessing option
  with new one but without description (p1, p2, p3 and p4). Options are `none`
  to use the raw_problem (or lp file) order for constraints and variables.
  `memory`, the default, to use the raw_problem (or lp file) order for
  constraints but sort the variables to improve the memory cache efficiency.

== baryonyx v0.3.2 - 2018-09-24

solver/optimizer::

* Be sure to always return the correct solution value (if any), the
  status (success, time-limit, kappa-limit, loop-limit) and the
  remaining constraints.
* Fix optimizer algorithm to store best constraints remaining
  solution.
* Fix push system in solver

general::

* add storage policy option to select the result solution vector
  policy (one best solution, best and worst solution and the five best
  solution).
* bump fmt library to v5.2.0

preprocessor::

* detect and affect variable affected in bound.

main::

* Add the `storage-type` option with a string parameter (one, bound
  and five).

== baryonyx v0.3.1 - 2018-09-18

main::

* fix typo in constraint-order parameter.
* fix exception output message.

preprocessor::

* replace the old preprocessor algorithm. The new one is better to remove
  constraints and variables and fix some issues.

solver::

* print solver parameters before solve/optimize

parser::

* fix the reading of the constraint label.
* add a default label to constraints.
* remove function elements where factors equals 0.
* merge function elements in constraints or in the objective function where
  variable index appears several times.
* remove constraints with empty function element vector.

problem::

* fix the coefficient_type function

== baryonyx v0.3.0 - 2018-09-11

general::

* enable x86 and x86-64 for both Release and Debug with Visual Studio
  2017

solver::

* Add small optimizer meta-heuristic algorithm, option `--auto:`:
** `none` without specific algorithm.
** `manual` tries to update parameters to found best solution.
** `nlopt` tries to update parameters to found best solution using
   nlopt library and the Nelder Mead algorithm.
** `branch` split recursively original problem to found best solution.
** `branch-manual` mix branch and manual algorithm.
** `branch-nlopt` mix branch and nlopt algorithm.

+ Add observation mechanism, option `-p observer:`:
** `none` no observation (default).
** `pnm` produce picture files for the P matrix (one per loop) and Pi
   vector (Lagrangian multipliers) each loop
** `file` produce CSV files for the P matrix (one per loop) and Pi
   vector (Lagrangian multipliers) each loop

* Add solvers:
** equalities 01
** equalities 101
** inequalities 01
** inequalities 101
** inequalities 101 buffered (experimental)
** inequalities Z (experimental)

* Update solver and main to enable the use of float (4 bytes), double
  (8 bytes) or long double (16 bytes for x86_64) for reduce costs,
  kappa, delta and preference matrix etc. Default is the use of
  double. To change the solver internal representation use the
  following command:

   $ baryonyx [...] --param floating-point-type=float|double|longdouble

* For constraints matrix A, add new static order for constraints (`-p
  preprocessing=option`) where option is defined as:
** `none` (default): use the lp format constraint order.
** `less,greater,equal` or `greater,less,equal` or any other form: use
   the type of operator
** `variables-number` (experimental): use number variable links.
** `variables-weight` (experimental): sort variables weights (sum
   variable appearance in all constraints).
** `constraints-weight` (experimental): use number constraint links.

* Add push system for solving process
* Add parameters in solution file
* Show violated constraints in solve mode

core::

* Objective function now use double instead of integer.

* Replace `serialize` with `print-level` in option to show information
  (e.g.  with `print-level=1` with the solve mode, violated
  constraints are displayed.

cmake::

* CMake use two options WITH_DEBUG (ON default), WITH_LOG (ON
  default).
** WITH_LOG enables logging system (using the BARYONYX_ENABLE_DEBUG
   preprocessor definition).
** WITH_DEBUG enable debug messages in logging system and some debug
   information (using the BARYONYX_ENABLE_DEBUG preprocessor
   definition).
* Add the nlopt dependency (optional) to perform automatic parameters
  optimization.
