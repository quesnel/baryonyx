# baryonyx v0.2.0.0 - 2017-10-03

## solver

- Add a new parameter norm (-p norm:string)
  -`none`: no normalization
  -`l1`: l1 norm (sum of absolute cost / cost number)
  -`l2`: l2 norm (sum of cost * cost / cost number)
  -`inf`: l+oo norm (max cost / cost number)
  -`rng`: a complex experimental norm

- Add an external solution checker. Use the `--check|-C [filename]`
  command line option to valid a `.sol` result with an another algorithm.

- Improve debug log facilities. If baryonyx:
  - is compiled without `BARYONYX_FULL_OPTIMIZATION`
  - have verbose level = 7 (`baryonyx-0.2 -v 7`)
  - have serialize option = 2 (`baryonyx-0.2 -v 7 -p serialize=2`)

  Then:

  The log facilities show:
  - current X solution with variable names compute() [`serialize >= 1`]
  - all constraints status for each compute() [`serialize >= 1`]
  - P matrix between for each update_row() [`serialize >= 2`]

- Write temporary solutions during optimization process
- Fix push system using cost vector
- Show variable names into dump
- Remove the inversion of the matrix A for negative coefficient
- Remove random gap to zero
- Use `std::sort` in full optimization, `std::stable_sort` otherwise

## preprocessor

Remove more constraints and variable

- Remove constraints and affects variables:

```
 x + y + z = 0
 x + y + z = 3
 x + y + z >= 3
 x + y + z <= 0
```

- Remove constraints:

```
x + y + z >= 0
x + y + z <= 3
```

- Remove multiple elements in objective function or constraints:

```
 x1 + x2 + x3 + x2 becomes x1 + 2x2 + x3).
```

- Remove null factor elements in objective function or constraints:

```
x1 + x2 becomes x2
```

- Remove affected variables in bounds or in constraints
- Remove duplicated constraints

## Core

Replace `long int` with `int`. The int or std::int32_t type to reference array index, variable index seems to be sufficient for all source code.

io: improve read with more 'subject to' syntax. This patch allows parser to
read lp file with `subject to[:]` syntax.
